# Node Express.js Server README

Welcome to the Node.js Express server project! This README provides an overview of the minimum structure and key components of the server.

## Project Overview

This Express.js server project includes the following core components:

1. `package.json` - This file contains the project's dependencies and configuration. It defines the packages and scripts needed to run and manage the server.

2. `src/index.js` - The main entry point of the Express.js server. This is where the server is initialized, configured, and started.

3. `src/router/router.js` - The primary router responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate endpoints.

4. `src/server/app.js` - The core application setup, where you can configure middleware, error handling, and other server settings.

5. `.gitignore` - A Git configuration file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by version control.

6. `.env` (not listed, but typically used) - An environment configuration file for managing environment-specific variables, such as database connection details and secret keys.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this Express.js server, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install project dependencies using `npm install`.

4. Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file and setting the necessary variables.

5. Start the server by running `npm start` script specified in `package.json`.
